    Welcome to the *Vaporwave Weather*, where the forecast is as unpredictable as the aesthetic is undeniable. 
    Get ready to plunge into a digital mirage of neon gradients, retro futurism, 
    and all the weather information you didn't know you needed, wrapped in a nostalgia you can't quite place.

## Overview

    Ever wondered what the weather would be like if it were a vaporwave album cover?
    Wonder no more! Our Vaporwave Weather App doesn't just tell you the weather;
    it transports you to a parallel digital utopia where the sunsets are always purple,
    the rain is digital, and the forecast is always synthwave.

## Features

    - **Aesthetic Forecasting**: Experience tomorrow’s rain through a pixelated haze and today’s sunshine in neon pink.
    - **Retro Wave Reliability**: Our forecasts are as reliable as a cassette tape. They might get twisted, but that’s just part of the charm.
    - **Synthwave Synopses**: Get your weather summary delivered in a synthesizer voice-over (coming soon, once we figure out the technology).
    - **Nostalgic Notifications**: Receive weather alerts that remind you of a past you never experienced.
